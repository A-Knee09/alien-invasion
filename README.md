# Alien Invasion (Pygame Project)

A small 2D game made using Python and Pygame.  
This is a project from the book *Python Crash Course* that I built after about a week of learning Python.

# How to Play

- Press the **Left** and **Right** arrow keys to move the ship.
- Press the **Spacebar** to shoot bullets upward.
- Press **Q** to quit the game.

The goal is to shoot down the incoming alien fleet before they reach the bottom or collide with your ship.
